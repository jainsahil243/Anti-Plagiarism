/**
 * This class encapsulates the game logic for a video game called Dots.
 * The game consists of a 2D array or grid of colored icons, called dots,
 * along with an ordered list that we will call the selection list.  Intuitively,
 * the selection list represents a set of adjacent dots, all of the same color,
 * that have been selected by the player.  When selection is complete (e.g. the
 * mouse is released), the selected dots disappear from the grid, and the dots
 * above shift down  to take their places.  Then new dots fill in each column from the top.
 * A point is scored for each dot that disappears from the grid.  There
 * is a special rule for the case that the selected dots form a loop;
 * then all dots in the grid of the same color disappear too.
